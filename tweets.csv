"805","After Essebsi became president, the vigor he'd plowed into pre-2015 politicking appeared rarely (eg: his years-long pursuit of 2017's Reconciliation Law). Meanwhile, on truly crucial matters (forming Constitutional Court, Nidaa collapse etc) he often seemed absent from the helm.","0"
"805","In Aug '13 the opposing camps leaders, Essebsi and Ghannouchi, met secretly in Paris. Their tense, mutually suspicious discussion breached the impasse and led to further talks, paving the way for Tunisia's Nobel Prize-winning National Dialogue to help resolve the impasse.","0"
"805","Tunisia's president, Essebsi, has died. He leaves a profoundly mixed legacy, having done much to both shepherd and sabotage Tunisia's transition. As president, he pursued soft resoration weakly, generally favouring impunity over democratic reform while his party, Nidaa, crumbled.","0"
"805","As president, Essebsi proved to be far less effective than his supporters had hoped and far less authoritarian than his critics had often feared. Tunisia's transition neither sank nor swam under his tenure, but chronically choked and sputtered- rudderless, wounded, yet still afloat.","0"
"805","In run-up to Tunisia's 2013 Bardo Crisis, Essebsi instigated dangerous calls to dissolve the country's Constituent Assembly w/o plans for a representative gov to replace it. Bardo swelled into a terrible impasse, nearly toppling transition. But in Aug '13 a breakthrough emerged","0"
"805","During 2013's Bardo Crisis, Essebsi acted as both a saboteur and saviour of Tunisian democracy. Though his demands endangered the transition, he later engaged in constructive dialogue w Ghannouchi, helping to claw Tunisia back from the brink of disaster.","0"
"805","To me, Essebsi's almost Shakespearean incapacity to prevent his son from domineering and arguably destroying Nidaa (which still exists but is riven into pieces and polling vv low) represents the greatest mystery of his tenure. Did Essebsi not see Nidaa through the lens of his legacy?","0"

"413","Not much, but if traded for, the contract becomes essentially a 2 year deal worth 24M per year, with 2 team options after it.

KC -7
PHI +7.5","0"
"413","Also, I don’t think the Eagles would necessarily get *anything* in return. Maybe a late, conditional pick if they’re lucky. A team might even try to get PHI to throw in a pick of their own.

"413","Saints ready to admit what Taysom actually is yet? He’s an awesome gadget guy who every team would love to have. He’s not a starting quarterback in this league, and never will be. 

He’s 30 years old and was the far inferior QB today to the rookie, 2nd rd pick making his 1st start.","0"
"413","I like you as well, Mike but games are two halves, not one. And Allen was objectively awful in the 1st half. 

And after his amazing opening month, Josh Allen has the most sub-90 QB rating of any QB in the league. 

He’s been a middling QB since Week 5. 

Great win, though!","0"
"413","This article lays amplifies the details I laid out this week: If Wentz isn’t the unquestioned Eagles’ starter for 2021, the only path forward is to trade him. 

A trade actually slightly lowers his PHI cap figure for 2021 and it’s off the books entirely for 2022 and beyond.","0"
"413","Here’s the video from last week where I lay it all out. 

IND seems like the most obvious trade partner. Frank Reich is there and they have 46M of QB contracts coming off the books this Summer. 

NE is also obviously a possibility with their cap situation and lack of a QB for 2021.","0"
"413","We are really leading into this game with a “Josh Allen MVP” conversation???
